# Course-End Project: Personal Expense Tracker

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, individuals need to track and manage their expenses effectively. Your task is to build a personal expense tracker that allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them, and track spending against a monthly budget. The tracker should also be able to save and load expenses from a file for future reference.

## Objectives

1. Design and implement a personal expense tracker that enables users to manage their expenses
2. Allow users to categorize expenses and set monthly budgets
3. Implement file-handling functionality to save and load expense data
4. Create an interactive, menu-driven interface for ease of use

---

## Steps to Perform

### 1. Add an Expense

- Create a function to prompt the user for expense details. Ensure you ask for:
  - The date of the expense in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
  - The category of the expense, such as `Food` or `Travel`
  - The amount spent
  - A brief description of the expense
- Store the expense in a list as a dictionary, where each dictionary includes the date, category, amount, and description as key-value pairs

  **Example:**
  ```python
  {'date': '2024-09-18', 'category': 'Food', 'amount': 15.50, 'description': 'Lunch with friends'}
  ```

### 2. View Expenses

- Write a function to retrieve and display all stored expenses
  - Ensure the function loops through the list of expenses and displays the date, category, amount, and description for each entry
- Validate the data before displaying it
  - If any required details (date, category, amount, or description) are missing, skip the entry or notify the user that it's incomplete

### 3. Set and Track the Budget

- Create a function that allows the user to input a monthly budget. Prompt the user to:
  - Enter the total amount they want to budget for the month
- Create another function that calculates the total expenses recorded so far
  - Compare the total with the user's monthly budget
  - If the total expenses exceed the budget, display a warning
    - Example: `You have exceeded your budget!`
  - If the expenses are within the budget, display the remaining balance
    - Example: `You have 150 left for the month`

### 4. Save and Load Expenses

- Implement a function to save all expenses to a CSV file, with each row containing the date, category, amount, and description of each expense
- Create another function to load expenses from the CSV file. When the program starts, it should:
  - Read the saved data from the file
  - Load it back into the list of expenses so the user can see their previous expenses and continue from where they left off

### 5. Create an Interactive Menu

- Build a function to display a menu with the following options:
  - Add expense
  - View expenses
  - Track budget
  - Save expenses
  - Exit
- Allow the user to enter a number to choose an option
- Implement the following conditions:
  - If the user selects option 1, call the function to add an expense
  - If the user selects option 2, call the function to view expenses
  - If the user selects option 3, call the function to track the budget
  - If the user selects option 4, call the function to save expenses to the file
  - If the user selects option 5, save the expenses and exit the program
